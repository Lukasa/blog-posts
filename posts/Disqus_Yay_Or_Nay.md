## Disqus: Yay or Nay?

Just a short post today. While I was hacking away at Minimalog, working out
how best to implement emails for blog comments, it occurred to me that this
might be a solved problem already. This led me to
[Disqus](http://disqus.com/).

So, this leads to my question: what do we think of Disqus? In its current
state, Minimalog doesn't use any Javascript or anything that would keep track
of users: adding Disqus would add both of these things. Do we think this
trade-off is worth it? Disqus seems like it's pretty lightweight, and would
reduce the number of things that Minimalog has to do itself, which is
probably for the best.

Let me know. Comment, or send me a tweet, and let me know.

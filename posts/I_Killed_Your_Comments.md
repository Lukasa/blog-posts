## Sorry, I Killed Your Comments

Another brief post. This blog is now trialling the use of
[Disqus](http://disqus.com) as a comment management tool. The code required
to do this can be found in the `disqus` branch of the
[Minimalog repo](https://github.com/Lukasa/minimalog).

The reason this warrants a blog post is that part of this change required me
to kill all of your comments. I have a backup of the comment database, but it
looks like a reasonable amount of quite boring work to transfer those comments
into Disqus, so I might simply not bother. This blog is young enough that the
absence of the comments on the older posts won't really matter too much.
Everyone gets a clean slate!

I promise, a real blog post will come a bit later, when the weather gets worse
and I'm less inclined to be out in it.

## An Investigation Into Hyper

I've been working on hyper for a long time now, and it's finally in a state
where I can do real comparisons between hyper and httplib. So I did! And just
to vary it up, rather than write it as a blog post, I decided to try doing it
as an iPython notebook.

If this is interesting I'll work on integrating its output into my blog proper,
rather than using nbviewer.

For now at least, you can find the investigation
[here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Lukasa/notebooks/blob/master/hyper_investigation.ipynb).
